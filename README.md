About

This project presents a simple WCF Greeting Service that demos architectural styles of setting up, hosting, configuring services, and testing for dual protocols: http and tcp. The service accepts a simple string, which represents a name, and returns a simple string with a greeting that acknowledges the name.  Instead of using IIS Express, the simple greeting service is hosted using a console application. The Visual Studio solution also has two client “tester” applications that test both the http and tcp protocol connections to the hosted service.
